<p>I have recently started using AngularJS in a project at work.  The project contains several forms with repeated elements.  Although Angular offers many useful directives of its own, I found myself authoring simple directives right away.  As with any code, whenever logic or layout is repeated again and again (e.g. a label and an input box), it makes great sense to encapsulate these elements together in a new partial element.  This way, if a change is required to all of the groups of labels and inputs, then you can simply make the change in one place, rather than hunting down those elements across multiple pages.  Fortunately, by allowing developers to write their own directives, Angular has provided a very easy way to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Extracting HTML code into a directive is usually a simple refactoring task.  However, in one particular instance I ran into a problem that I did not anticipate.  In this case, I was trying to extract a label and a select into a directive so that I could reuse it and keep my code dry.  I easily developed a directive and copied my layout code into a template.  However, I found that my directive would not print the way that I had intended it to.  The select options would not expand into the list despite my code being a direct one to one copy of the code I had written in my route template.</p> 

<h3>The broken directive</h3>
<p>My first attempt at this directive was a failure, the code for that attempt can be found below.  Also, there is a CodePen for testing out the code yourself.  If you are an Angular buff, I would encourage you to try to fix my CodePen before you read on and see my solution.  You might come up with a better solution than I did.</p>
<h4>Broken directive code:</h4>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js linenums">
myApp.directive('specialSelect', [function(){
return {
    restrict: 'A',
    transclude: true,

    template: '&lt;label ng-transclude&gt;&lt;/label&gt;' \ 
                &lt;select ng-model="ngModel" ng-options="&#123;&#123;ngOptions&#125;&#125;" class="form-control"&gt; \
                &lt;/select&gt;',
    scope: {
        ngOptions: '@ngOption',
        ngModel: '='
    }
};
}]);
</pre>
</div>
<h4>The same directive in use:</h4>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;div special-select ng-model="currentBusinessStructure" ng-option="item for item in businessStructure" &gt;How is your business structured?&lt;\div&gt;
</pre>

<h3>The working directive</h3>
<p>In order make my directive more reusable, I had defined a scope block and defined a couple of variables so that I could pass down the options and model data that my angular select element would need.  This allows me to use different options and different models for each special-select element I use in a page.  However, when you assign a scope property the directive may no longer access the data in the scope of its parent controller.  In the angular documentation, this is called <em>isolate scope</em>.  This means that when I passed down an angular expression that referred to a variable in the parent controller's scope "item for item in <em>businessStructure</em>", my directive could not really use that data.  As a workaround, I decided to add a data property to my directive so that I could pass the options data variable to my directive, and as long as I refer to the new variable name in my angular expression, the select should print out fine.  You can find my functional code below.</p>
<h4>Directive code:</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js linenums">
myApp.directive('specialSelect', [function(){
return {
    restrict: 'A',
    transclude: true,

    template: '&lt;label ng-transclude&gt;&lt;/label&gt;' \ 
                &lt;select ng-model="ngModel" ng-options="&#123;&#123;ngOptions&#125;&#125;" class="form-control"&gt; \
                &lt;/select&gt;',
    scope: {
        ngOptions: '@ngOption',
        ngModel: '=',
        data: '='
    }
};
}]);
</pre>

<h4>The same directive in use:</h4>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;div special-select ng-model="currentBusinessStructure" ng-option="item for item in data" data="businessStructure"&gt;How is your business structured?&lt;\div&gt;
